        Retrieves information on all symbols/code entities (classes, methods, etc.) based on the given name path pattern.
        The returned symbol information can be used for edits or further queries.
        Specify `depth > 0` to also retrieve children/descendants (e.g., methods of a class).

        A name path is a path in the symbol tree *within a source file*.
        For example, the method `my_method` defined in class `MyClass` would have the name path `MyClass/my_method`.
        If a symbol is overloaded (e.g., in Java), a 0-based index is appended (e.g. "MyClass/my_method[0]") to
        uniquely identify it.

        To search for a symbol, you provide a name path pattern that is used to match against name paths.
        It can be
         * a simple name (e.g. "method"), which will match any symbol with that name
         * a relative path like "class/method", which will match any symbol with that name path suffix
         * an absolute name path "/class/method" (absolute name path), which requires an exact match of the full name path within the source file.
        Append an index `[i]` to match a specific overload only, e.g. "MyClass/my_method[1]".

            If a directory is passed, the search will be restricted to the files in that directory.
            If a file is passed, the search will be restricted to that file.
            If you have some knowledge about the codebase, you should use this parameter, as it will significantly
            speed up the search as well as reduce the number of results.
        :param include_body: If True, include the symbol's source code. Use judiciously.
        :param include_kinds: Optional. List of LSP symbol kind integers to include. (e.g., 5 for Class, 12 for Function).

            "Foo/get" would match "Foo/getValue" and "Foo/getData".
        :param max_answer_chars: Max characters for the JSON result. If exceeded, no content is returned.
